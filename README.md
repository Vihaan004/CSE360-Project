## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an Office Automation System specifically designed for a Pediatric Doctor's Office. Targeted users include doctors, nurses, and patients (or their parents/guardians). The primary goal of this software is to minimize paperwork and enhance the accessibility of patient records. Although the ideal implementation would be accessible via both web and mobile applications, the scope of this project, as part of the CSE 360 class, is limited to creating a GUI-based desktop application. This application will be developed using Java UI techniques learned in CSE 205 and enhanced with JavaFX.

## System Operation and Functionality
### Initial Interaction
- Upon a patient's arrival, a staff nurse performs the initial meet and greet.
- The nurse records vital statistics (weight, height, body temperature, and blood pressure for patients over 12) and enters them into the system associated with the patient's current visit.

### Examination Room Process
- Patients are then escorted to the examination room to wait for the doctor.
- The nurse conducts a preliminary health interview, asking about allergies, health concerns, etc., and inputs this information into the system.
- The nurse can view the patient's history, including past health issues, medication, and immunization records.

### Doctor's Examination
- The doctor examines the patient, records findings, and, if necessary, prescribes medication directly into the system for transmission to the patient's pharmacy.
- The doctor can access the patient's comprehensive medical history during the examination.

### Patient Portal
- Allows patients to create a unique account using their first name, last name, and birthday.
- Patients can update contact information, view visit summaries, and send health-related inquiries to the medical staff.
- The messaging system enables direct communication between patients and healthcare providers, with the option for urgent phone contact if necessary.
