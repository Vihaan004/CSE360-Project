## Project Overview
This project endeavors to create an Office Automation System tailored for Pediatric Doctor's Offices, catering to doctors, nurses, and patients (or their guardians). Its principal objective is to reduce paperwork and improve the accessibility of patient records. While the ideal system would be accessible via web and mobile platforms, the project's scope, as part of the CSE 360 class, is confined to developing a GUI-based desktop application. This application will leverage Java UI techniques acquired in CSE 205, augmented with JavaFX.

## System Operation and Functionality
### Initial Interaction
- When the patient arrives, a staff nurse performs the initial meet and greet.
- The nurse records vital statistics (weight, height, body temperature, and blood pressure for patients over 12) and enters them into the system associated with the patient's current visit.

### Examination Room Process
- Patients are then escorted to the examination room to wait for the doctor.
- The nurse conducts a preliminary health interview, asking about allergies, health concerns, etc., and inputs this information into the system.
- The nurse can view the patient's history, including past health issues, medication, and immunization records.

### Doctor's Examination
- The doctor examines the patient, records findings, and, if necessary, prescribes medication directly into the system for transmission to the patient's pharmacy.
- The doctor can access the patient's comprehensive medical history during the examination.

### Patient Portal
- Allows patients to create a unique account using their first name, last name, and birthday.
- Patients can update contact information, view visit summaries, and send health-related inquiries to the medical staff.
- The messaging system enables direct communication between patients and healthcare providers, with the option for urgent phone contact if necessary.
